# write a Python program that uses at least five built-in functions (e.g., len(),max(),sorted(),sum(), and type()) to perform operations on a list of numbers.

numbers=[3,7,2,9,5,4,5,6,8]

# Find the length of the list

length_of_list = len(numbers)
print("Length of the list:", length_of_list)

# Find the maximum value in the list

max_value = max(numbers)
print("Maximum value in the list:", max_value)

# Sort the list in ascending order

sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
print("Sorted list in ascending order:", sorted_numbers)

# Calculate the sum of all values in the list

sum_of_numbers = sum(numbers)
print("Sum of all values in the list:", sum_of_numbers)

# Check the type of the list

type_of_list = type(numbers)
print("Type of the list:", type_of_list)
